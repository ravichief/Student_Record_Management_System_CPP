/*
Name of project: Student Record Management System

The project structure informs you about the file management system. The developed program will correctly store all the studentsâ€™ information. The data can be any information about the student, their personal details, roll number, academic records, etc (At least 5) along with their marks in 3 subjects along with their percentage with the grading system- A-60%+ , B- 40%+, F- <40% .
